        <p class="paragraph">Hello! My name is Kathrylle Rosario, I'm currently a sophomore who is attending Aiea High School.</p>

        <div id="about">
            <p class="paragraph">I was born and raised in the Philippines. At the age of 3, I moved to Hawaii. An extracurricular activity I do is Marching Band. In Marching Band, I don't play an instrument but instead I spin flag or rifle. I love listening to music, read books and watching anime. In my free time, I play video games on my Nintendo Switch or hanging out with family and friends. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Description: My group designed a video for +12 year olds to expand their vocabulary. </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Process and Planning: First we brainstormed, rough draft our ideas, then we sketched out ideas of what our final product would be and finally, we made our own characters for the game.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">What I learned: Communication is an important key for group work. Design a creative and engaging video games for players to enjoy.</p>
        
         <p class="paragraph">What I could've done differently: Manage my time more wisely and change some of the designs of my characters.</p>
        
        <p class="pt">Scratch Game Design</p>

        <p class="paragraph"> Instructions: Pop as much bubbles as you can under 30 seconds! Once 30 seconds is over, it's game over for you! See how many bubbles you can pop.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Process and Planning: First, I just tried different functions that scratch offered so I can see what purpose they do. Then I brainstormed what games I can create, after that I settled on one of my ideas and start coding it out.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">What I learned: Coding a game takes a lot of time to do so it's best to manage my time wisely.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">What I could've done differently: Add music in the background and make the game more challenging for the player. </p>
        
        <p class="pt">Arduino Project</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Description: I created a fully functional single-board microcontroller program. </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Process and Planning: First I did a tutorial on how to operate the arduino kit. Then I look at the other tutorials that was offered. I planned to choose the traffic lights one because it was simply and easy to replicate. I decided to add an LED light to the program due to the requirement of the project of adding something different from the tutorial. </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">What I learned: Programming a single-board is diffcult then what it seems. Pay attention on how you place different components on the board because it can affect how it's suppose to operate.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">What I could've done differently: Choose a different tutorial to replicate becuase the tutorial I did was kind of easy and less time consuming. I wanted a challenge, something that would rack my brain with.</p>
